# Architect

Architect designs, simulates, and documents full-stack environments. It generates Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests, visualizes network topologies, and optimizes for resilience, scalability, and cost. Ideal for homelab orchestration, field deployments, and IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) generation pipelines.
