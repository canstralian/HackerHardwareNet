  "content": "# Building a Rogue Access Point with Raspberry Pi\n\nThis tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a rogue access point (AP) using a Raspberry Pi. This setup can be used in a controlled environment to understand network vulnerabilities and demonstrate man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Please remember that using this for unauthorized access or malicious activities is illegal and unethical. This tutorial is for educational purposes only.\n\n## What you'll learn:\n- Configure wireless interfaces in monitor mode\n- Set up DHCP and DNS spoofing\n- Implement transparent SSL proxying\n- Analyze captured network traffic\n\n## Prerequisites:\n- Raspberry Pi (Model 3 B+ or later recommended)\n- Raspberry Pi OS (Lite version is sufficient)\n- MicroSD card (at least 16GB)\n- USB WiFi adapter (one that supports monitor mode)\n- Ethernet cable (for internet access)\n- A computer to SSH into the Raspberry Pi\n\n**Estimated Time:** 2.5 hours\n\n**Difficulty:** Advanced\n\n## Step 1: Setting up the Raspberry Pi\n\n- Install Raspberry Pi OS onto your microSD card\n- Enable SSH for headless setup\n- Connect to the Pi via SSH\n- Update the system packages\n- Install necessary tools (hostapd, dnsmasq, iptables)\n\n## Step 2: Configuring the Wireless Interface\n\n- Identify your WiFi adapters with iwconfig\n- Stop network services\n- Configure monitor mode on the wireless interface\n- Verify the interface is in monitor mode\n\n## Step 3: Setting up the Rogue Access Point\n\n- Create and configure hostapd.conf\n- Set up your chosen SSID and security parameters\n- Start the hostapd service\n\n## Step 4: Setting up DHCP and DNS Spoofing\n\n- Configure dnsmasq for DHCP server\n- Set up DNS spoofing rules\n- Configure static IP for the wireless interface\n- Restart networking services\n\n## Step 5: Enabling IP Forwarding and NAT\n\n- Enable IP forwarding for traffic routing\n- Configure iptables for NAT\n- Make rules persistent across reboots\n\n## Step 6: Implementing SSL Proxying\n\n- Install and configure mitmproxy\n- Redirect HTTP/HTTPS traffic\n- Capture and analyze web traffic\n\n## Step 7: Analyzing Network Traffic\n\n- Capture traffic with tcpdump/tshark\n- Analyze captured packets\n- Identify security vulnerabilities\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Only use in controlled environments with permission\n- Understand legal implications of unauthorized usage\n- Properly secure your testing environment\n- Clean up after testing\n\nThis tutorial provides a foundation for understanding network security.
