Improving UX for technical portals—especially those focused on learning, tools, and hardware documentation—requires a mix of clarity, accessibility, and efficient navigation. Based on the structure and content of the provided portal, the following UX improvements significantly enhance readability:

1. **Hierarchical Navigation and Categorization**: Grouping content under clearly labeled sections (e.g., "HARDWARE PLATFORMS", "SECURITY TOOLS", "RESOURCES") provides intuitive wayfinding, minimizing cognitive load.

2. **Consistent and Legible Typography**: The use of system-ui and monospace fonts for general and code-related content respectively ensures legibility across platforms and contexts, supporting both textual and technical comprehension.

3. **Whitespace and Padding**: Adequate spacing between elements (such as in `.5rem .75rem` padding for inputs) reduces clutter, helping users process information more easily.

4. **Semantic HTML Elements**: Use of `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, `<nav>` for navigation, and descriptive `<a>` tags improves structure, accessibility, and screen reader compatibility.

5. **Minimalist Visual Design**: A clean, borderless design with clear hover/click states and reduced visual noise allows users to focus on core content, which is especially important in technical domains where clarity matters.

6. **Contextual Search Bar**: A prominently placed "Search knowledge base..." field facilitates quick access to precise information, a must-have for documentation-heavy portals.

7. **Persistent Navigation**: Fixed or consistently accessible menus (e.g., [Home], [Learning Paths], [Articles]) promote user orientation and allow users to return to known locations easily.

8. **Highlighting Functional Elements**: Tool categories like [Compatibility Checker] and platform-specific links offer actionable paths, enhancing user engagement with targeted utility.
